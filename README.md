# android-bootunlock-bruteforce

App to brute-force test for the correct unlock code for an android bootloader.
Bases on: https://github.com/haexhub/huaweiBootloaderHack
with some improvements.

Personally used to unlock the bootloader of an outdated Huawei P10 Lite
smart phone as Huawei took down the webpage to request for an unlock key.
